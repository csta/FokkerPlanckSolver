# FokkerPlanckSolver
Numerical Approximation to the Fokker Planck Equation using the WPE algorithm

The solver is based off of the Wang, Peskin, and Elston method (WPE) and is described in <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~hongwang/publications/Numerical_JTB.pdf">Numerical_JTB</a>.

In additon, a diagnolly implicit Runge-Kutta method (or DIRK) is used for evolving the system.
